# Monocular_Visual_Odometry
it is monocular visual odometry for KITTI dataset in Python.    
reference repository : <https://github.com/uoip/monoVO-python>   

original data is more than 4000frame but it is so huge for git hub repository.   
therefore data in this repository is 200frame images so playtime is very short.   
if you have original data,you can use it by editting path in "test.py"   

test.py,visual_odometry.py --> it is almost same code in reference repository
grid feature.py --> it is code changed method that find visual feature
